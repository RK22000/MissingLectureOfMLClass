**The Missing Lecture of your ML Class**

Topics covered
------------------------
Environment Setup
:   We'll cover how to set up two different kinds of virtual environments for your projects
    
    Why you might want to do so?

    And compare how conda and venv stack up next to each other

Deploying and sharing your projects
:   We'll look at ways to share your projects in an interactive so its easier to appreciate your work

    For this we will use a combination of Binder, Voila, and Ipywidgets

Making plots, visualizations, and animations
:   We'll look at some convenient ways to create visualizations in python

Prerequisites
------------------------
You'll need to have met the following prerequisites to complete the workshop in its entirety

* Able to clone git environments

Environment Setup
=============================

![XKCD Python environments](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment_2x.png)

Why bother with this?

* Don't want to mess up your computer
* Want to be able to use lots of cool packages and libraries

Venv and Conda (and Mamba)
------------------------

    Venv    |   [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) ([Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
------------|------------------------
Manages python dependencies | Manages all kinds of dependencies
Installs packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) | Installs packages from many different channels [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org/packages/), [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo)
Kinda faster than conda | Kinda slower than Pip, Mamba a C implementation uses paralyzation to speed things up

Create a Venv environments
------------------------

```sh
python -m venv <path-to-virtual-env>
venv\Scripts\activate.bat # for windows
source venv\bin\activate
```

Create a Conda environments
------------------------

```sh
conda env create -p <path-to-virtual-env>
# or
conda env create -n <name-of-virtual-env>
```
